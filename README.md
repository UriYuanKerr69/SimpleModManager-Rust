# Mod Manager

A simple tool to manage and install mods from various archive formats. This tool has been created using Rust, and I legally am not responsible for any damage caused using this tool.

I am also a very new developer with very little experience (Grok is my friend), and therefore I am greatful for any help and support to build this free resource for use with any game which uses '.zip' and/or '.7z' archives, while remembering the output destination for future reference. I initially created this to assist new mod users to install mods into Balatro.

## Features
- Install mods from `.zip` and `.7z` archives.
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- Simple GUI for selecting archive files and installation directories.

## Installation
### From Source
1. Install Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:<UriYuanKerr69>/SimpleModManager-Rust.git
