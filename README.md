# Simple Mod Manager for Balatro

A simple tool to manage and install mods from various archive formats. This tool has been created using Rust, and I legally am not responsible for any damage caused using this tool. This tool you choose to use at your own risk, and therefore comes with zero support from its developers.

I am also a very new developer with very little experience (Grok is my teacher and friend), and therefore I am greatful for any help and support to build this free resource for use with any game which uses '.zip' and/or '.7z' archives, while remembering the output destination for future reference. I initially created this to assist new mod users to install mods into Balatro, however the installer will work for any game which has supported archived mods.

## Features
- Install mods from `.zip` and `.7z` archives.
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- Simple GUI for selecting archive files and installation directories.

## Future Features
Check the Issue Tracker for these.
